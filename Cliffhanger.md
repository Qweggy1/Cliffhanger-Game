# Cliffhanger-Game
A text based adventure game developed and coded with a team of 4 including myself in Python and VSC.

Cliffhanger was developed with code nation for a project into learning Python and Visual Studio Code. The game works perfectly within 
Visual Studio Code, cliffhanger had 3 days for development and therefore time was not on our side. The preject you currently see is
everything we coded as a team. We planned, used trello, zoom daily and shared code within Slack. 

This was the final result of all our work 
as a team and it was a very fun and interesting 3 days to plan, create and make.
